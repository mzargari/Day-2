### Derivatives in R

Find the derivative of $$f(x) = 5x^2$$

```{r}
ex_1 <- expression (5 * x ^ 2) #This coerces 5x^2 into an expression which deriv understabds

my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x") #this runs the derivative in terms of x
my_derivative

x <- 2.8                          #This could even be a sequence of numbers which it will compute it for each one
eval(my_derivative)               #This tells my_derivative to run
```

Find the slope of $g(z) = 2z^3 - 10.5z^2 + 4.1$ <!-- # this is in line LATEX -->

```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * z^3 - 10.5 * z^2 + 4.1)

dg_dz <- D(gz, 'z')     # This is the same as deriv()
dg_dz

# Let's evaluate the slope over a range of values
z <- seq(from = -3, to = 4, by = 0.5)

eval(dg_dz)
```
